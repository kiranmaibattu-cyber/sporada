# Sporada Secure

`Sporada Secure` is the product name and `sporada-secure` is the solution-pack
identifier used in desired state, events, contracts, and the runtime graph.

## Current release

- Runtime source: `edge_runtime/solution_packs/sporada_secure/runtime_v14/`
- Delivery contract: `delivery/apexfabric-v1/intel-285h/sporada-secure-v14/`
- Workload Dockerfile: `docker/Dockerfile.sporada-v14`
- Build script: `scripts/build_sporada_v14_image.sh`
- Live acceptance test: `scripts/test_sporada_v14_face_delivery_live.py`
- Published image: `ghcr.io/kiranmaibattu-cyber/sporada:intel-285h-2026.09.21-v14`
- Immutable image: `ghcr.io/kiranmaibattu-cyber/sporada@sha256:292645ce6e7faa562e4fedbdb75f94ff9c1244fd175d07723dfa453199b82b86`

The runtime directory is a product-owned snapshot. The v14 Dockerfile no
longer reads application code from the older shared
`edge_runtime/solution_packs/traffic/runtime_v11/` path.

## Shared versioned dependencies

- `models/sporada-secure-v14/openvino/`: INT8 YOLO26n person/vehicle detector,
  plate detector, OCR, and smoke/fire models. The person/vehicle model runs on
  the Intel GPU and retains the v14 `[1,3,640,640] -> [1,300,6]` detector
  contract.
- `models/sporada-secure-v14/face/openvino/`: face detector and embedding models.
- `sporada-intel-runtime-base:intel-285h-2026.09.18-v2`: Ubuntu,
  Intel GPU/NPU userspace, FFmpeg, Python, and OpenVINO dependencies.

These dependencies are copied into the workload image during the build. There
is no runtime link to `/home/admin1/traffic-pilot-main` or another source
repository.

## Deployment inputs

- `/configs`: desired state.
- `/run/secrets/apexfabric`: camera `.url` Secrets.
- `/state`: persistent events, snapshots, metrics, and face-delivery outbox.
- `/dev/dri` and `/dev/accel`: Intel GPU and NPU devices.

Successfully delivered face crops remain under `/state/snapshots` so SSE event
URLs continue to resolve. They are telemetry copies governed by the common
24-hour, 6-8 GiB snapshot-retention policy; management owns the durable biometric
artifact delivered before the embedding.
